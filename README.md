# claude-ast

AST-backed code navigation for Claude Code — precise, structural answers over a
real Python syntax tree, with **graded confidence** for a dynamic language.

Claude Code navigates code by grepping text. Text can't tell a definition from a
call, follow an import, or name the callers of a function. `claude-ast` answers
those as precise queries over a Python AST index — and, where a dynamic language
makes an answer uncertain, it tells you *how sure it is* rather than guessing.

```console
$ claude-ast repo-map src --focus claude_ast.query --budget 300
claude_ast.query.relations
  class Reference    # One end of a relationship: the other symbol, plus how/where and how sure.
  def find_callers(graph, symbol) -> list[Reference]    # Symbols that call `symbol`.
  ...
$ claude-ast callers claude_ast.cli._cmd_index src
src/claude_ast/cli.py:50  [definite] call  claude_ast.cli.main
```

## Status

The **P1 engine and the P2 resolver stack are complete**, validated on the Django
source tree (~17.7k symbols in the `django/` package; warm re-index ~0.3s). The
**P3 MCP server** (`claude-ast-mcp`) now serves the engine to Claude Code over
stdio; the live filesystem watcher is what remains. Nothing here calls an LLM —
it's fully deterministic and local.

## What it does

One shared AST index, three query families:

- **Lookup** — `find_definition`, `outline`
- **Relationships** — `find_callers`, `find_references`, `find_dependencies` (each result tiered `definite` / `possible`)
- **Orientation** — `repo_map` (a ranked, token-budgeted skeleton)

## Architecture

```
ingest → resolve (per backend) → store (sqlite + in-mem graph) → query (+ ranker) → server (mcp)
                                        ↑
                                     watch — feeds changed files back in  [P3]
```

- **`model/`** — the normalized contract (`Symbol` / `Edge` / `Resolution{source, confidence}`) every layer speaks.
- **`ingest/`** — language backends behind an `Indexer` protocol; `ingest/python/` is the one backend (all `ast` lives there). Produces symbols + syntactic edges.
- **`store/`** — SQLite snapshot for warm restart + per-file incremental, behind a `Store` protocol.
- **`query/`** — pure functions over the graph: lookups, relationships, and `repo_map` (confidence-weighted PageRank).
- **`index.py`** — the `Index` orchestrator (the facade the CLI and later the MCP server use).

Design principles: **own the whole stack** (our own parser + resolvers; external
engines can slot in later), **deterministic & local** (no LLM, no external
service, no API cost), and **report, don't rule** — every edge carries an honest
confidence tier, so `definite` really means definite.

## CLI

```console
claude-ast index <path>              # build/update the index; print a summary
claude-ast status <path>             # index freshness (cold vs. warm snapshot)
claude-ast def <name> [path]         # where a name is defined
claude-ast outline <module> [path]   # a module's symbols
claude-ast callers <symbol> [path] [--min-confidence high|medium|low]   # who calls a symbol
claude-ast deps <symbol> [path] [--min-confidence high|medium|low]      # what a symbol uses
claude-ast repo-map [path] [--focus <id>] [--budget N]
```

`callers` / `deps` take `--min-confidence` (default `medium`): the consumer's dial from
the reliable set (definite + typed guesses) down to the `low` name-match heuristics —
fetched only when the recall is worth the noise. The engine always *reports* every edge
at honest confidence; the caller decides how much to pull. This is the knob the MCP tools
expose so the model can widen its own view on demand.

The index persists at `<root>/.claude-ast/index.db` (self-ignoring;
`CLAUDE_AST_CACHE_DIR` relocates it centrally).

## MCP server

```console
claude-ast-mcp [path]                # serve the index to Claude Code over stdio
```

A FastMCP stdio server — one long-lived process per project — exposing the read-only
queries above as tools (`find_definition`, `outline`, `find_callers`, `find_dependencies`,
`repo_map`), returning structured JSON with `--min-confidence` on the relation tools.
Diagnostics go to stderr; stdout carries the protocol.

## Development

```console
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check
uv run pyright
```

See `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions and `tests/README.md` for the test
architecture.

## Roadmap

- **Landed since P1:** the **external-reference boundary** — library/stdlib targets surface as `external` nodes on `find_dependencies`, as `definite` edges kept out of ranking (deterministic — import text only). Covers from-import calls, external base classes, and **module-rooted attribute calls** (`os.path.join()`, dotted bases like `abc.ABC`); the external-id scheme is backend-owned, so a JS/TS backend can encode richer coordinates. The lean id-scheme fixes (`#N` disambiguation, single id-assignment authority, no neutral id-parsing) are in; the structured module/member id redesign stays deferred past P2.
- **P2 (in progress):** the value-typed resolver stack — the `possible`-tier edges that make "report, don't rule" earn its keep. **Landed:** `self.m()` → the enclosing class's member (+ cross-file inherited); annotation-typed receivers (`u: User` → `User.save`); local **construction inference** (`x = User(); x.save()`); **relative-import resolution** (`from ..model import X`); and **package re-export resolution** (`from pkg import X` follows `pkg/__init__` to the real defining module). All value-typed edges are `MEDIUM`/possible. a **builtins** pass (`len` / `Exception` → `definite` external edges); and a capped name-match **heuristic** (`LOW`) for untyped receivers — completing the confidence ladder (definite → medium → low). Plus a **call-site type-observation reporter** — a *definite* `RECEIVES_ARG` edge for the concrete type seen flowing into a parameter (`g(User())` → `g` receives `User`). This reports *what was passed*, not *what a call dispatches to*, so unlike the receiver resolvers it is honestly definite (open-world subclassing can't retract an observation) — the first non-syntactic `definite` edge "report, don't rule" actually permits. Lint-grade and one-hop (constructions only, bare-name functions only, no forward propagation); external-type and method/constructor callees are deferred, so it fires only where in-tree classes flow into in-tree functions. All measured by **resolution metrics**: `claude-ast index` reports coverage + the tier/source split (its own `src/`: **~69% of refs bound**, 365 definite / 33 possible), the loop that drove the builtins win (44% → 68%). **Note:** the originally-planned *confidence merge* (escalate a corroborated edge to `definite`) was dropped as a "report, don't rule" violation — method dispatch is never definite, so the definiteness belongs on the observation, never on the derived dispatch edge. Plus **stdlib stub resolution** — a receiver typed by an *external* stdlib type (`p: Path; p.exists()`) resolves to a `MEDIUM` STUB edge on an external member node, behind a `StubProvider` seam. The member table is **generated-then-frozen**: `tools/python/gen_stubs.py` introspects the *intersection* of callable members across the supported Python range (3.12–3.14) into a committed literal, so the index-time lookup is pure and hermetic (no site-packages, no interpreter drift) — all impurity quarantined in the offline generator. The seam is shaped (`member(type, attr) -> bool`) so an environment-aware provider for third-party stubs (`django-stubs`) can slot in later without touching the resolver; it needs no cache fingerprint because resolution is assembly-time and self-corrects. Two guards detect a stale table (a spec fingerprint + a per-interpreter soundness check; `tools/python/gen_stubs.py check` is the authoritative matrix gate — the generator is one self-orchestrating command, no Make/shell glue). Real recall: `src` 69→**73.8%**, Django +274 edges. **Next:** the env-aware third-party-stub provider (bounded ROI — `django-stubs`' hard types are mypy-plugin-computed, not in `.pyi`); and extending call-site observations to external/method callees.
- **P3 (in progress):** the MCP server + live watcher. **Landed:** the **stderr logging seam** (`log.configure()` — diagnostics to stderr, so stdout stays a clean data/protocol channel; a skipped file is now visible on *every* command, not silently dropped by all but `index`); and the **MCP server** itself — `claude-ast-mcp [root]`, a FastMCP stdio server (one long-lived process per project) exposing the CLI-validated queries as read-only tools (`find_definition`, `outline`, `find_callers`, `find_dependencies`, `repo_map`), each returning structured JSON, with the `min_confidence` knob on the relation tools so the model widens its own view on demand. Verified end-to-end over a real stdio client (handshake → `list_tools` → tool calls). **Next:** the live filesystem watcher (`watchfiles`) + an incremental `IndexSession` that holds the graph and patches changed files (atomic swap), so the served index stays fresh across edits without a full rebuild.
